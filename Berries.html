<h2>What are Berries</h2>
<p>In everyday language, a berry is a small, pulpy, and often edible fruit.<br> 
<a href="/content/berries.html" title="go to the berries page"> berries</a>
are usually juicy, rounded, brightly colored, sweet or sour, and do not have a stone or pit, although many pips or seeds may be present.<br> Common examples are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, red currants, and blackcurrants.[2] In Britain, soft fruit is a horticultural term for such fruits.<br>

The scientific usage of the term "berry" differs from common usage.<br> In scientific terminology, a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower in which the outer layer of the ovary wall develops into an edible fleshy portion (pericarp).<br> The definition includes many fruits that are not commonly known as 
<a href="/content/berries.html" title="go to the berries page"> berries</a>
, such as grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants (aubergines) and 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> Bananas</a>
.<br> Fruits excluded by the botanical definition include strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are aggregate fruits, and mulberries, which are multiple fruits.<br> A plant bearing

is said to be bacciferous or baccate.<br>
<br>
While many 
<a href="/content/berries.html" title="go to the berries page"> berries</a>
are edible, some are poisonous to humans, such as deadly nightshade and pokeweed.<br> Others, such as the white mulberry, red mulberry, and elderberry, are poisonous when unripe, but are edible when ripe.<br>
<br>

are eaten worldwide and often used in jams, preserves,

or pies.<br> Some 
<a href="/content/berries.html" title="go to the berries page"> berries</a>
are commercially important.<br> The 
<a href="/content/berries.html" title="go to the berries page"> berries</a>
industry varies from country to country as do types of 
<a href="/content/berries.html" title="go to the berries page"> berries</a>
cultivated or growing in the wild.<br> Some 
<a href="/content/berries.html" title="go to the berries page"> berries</a> 
such as raspberries and strawberries have been bred for hundreds of years and are distinct from their wild counterparts, while other 
<a href="/content/Moheaxberries.html" title="go to the berries page"> berries</a>
, such as lingonberries and cloudberries, grow almost exclusively in the wild.<br>
