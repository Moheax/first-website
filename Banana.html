<h2>What is a banana</h2>
<P>The 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.<br> In some countries, 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> bananas</a>
used for cooking may be called plantains, in contrast to dessert
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> bananas</a>
.<br> The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.<br> The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant.<br> Almost all modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> bananas</a>
come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.<br> The scientific names of most cultivated 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M.<br> balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution.<br> The old scientific name Musa sapientum is no longer used.<br>
<br>
Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea.<br> They are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
wine, and 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
beer and as ornamental plants.<br> The world's largest producers of 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
in 2016 were India and China, which together accounted for 28% of total production.<br>
<br>
Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between "
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
" and "plantains".<br> Especially in the Americas and Europe, "
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> bananas</a>
, particularly those of the Cavendish group, which are the main exports from 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
-growing countries.<br> By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called "plantains".<br> In other regions, such as Southeast Asia, many more kinds of 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.<br>
<br>
The term "
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit.<br> This can extend to other members of the genus Musa, such as the scarlet 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
(Musa coccinea), the pink 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
(Musa velutina), and the Fe'i 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> bananas</a>
.<br> It can also refer to members of the genus Ensete, such as the snow 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
(Ensete glaucum) and the economically important false 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
(Ensete ventricosum).<br> Both genera are in the 
<a href="/content/banana.html" title="go to the banana page"> banana</a>
family, Musaceae.<br>
