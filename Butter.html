<h2>What is Butter</h2>
<p>
<a href="/content/butter.html" title="go to the butter page"> Butter</a>
is a dairy product containing up to 80% butterfat (in commercial products) which is solid when chilled and at room temperature in some regions and liquid when warmed. It is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the butterfat from the buttermilk. It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted

products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, as well as in cooking, such as baking, sauce making, and pan frying. 
<a href="/content/butter.html" title="go to the butter page"> Butter</a>
consists of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and in some types, added salt.

or ghee, which is almost entirely butterfat.

<a href="/content/butter.html" title="go to the butter page"> Butter</a>
is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream; in a water-in-oil emulsion, the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. 
<a href="/content/butter.html" title="go to the butter page"> Butter</a>
remains a solid when refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32–35 °C (90–95 °F). The density of 
<a href="/content/butter.html" title="go to the butter page"> butter</a>
is 911 g/L (0.950 lb per US pint). It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its unmodified color is dependent on the animals' feed and genetics but is commonly manipulated with food colorings in the commercial manufacturing process, most commonly annatto or carotene.
