<h2>What is an Broccoli </h2>
<p>
<a href="/content/broccoli.html" title="go to the broccoli page"> Broccoli</a>
is an edible green plant in the cabbage family whose large flowering head is eaten as a vegetable.

The word 
<a href="/content/broccoli.html" title="go to the broccoli page"> broccoli</a>
comes from the Italian plural of broccolo, which means "the flowering crest of a cabbage", and is the diminutive form of brocco, meaning "small nail" or "sprout".
<a href="/content/broccoli.html" title="go to the broccoli page"> Broccoli</a>
is often boiled or steamed but may be eaten raw.
<a href="/content/broccoli.html" title="go to the broccoli page"> Broccoli</a>
is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea. 
<a href="/content/broccoli.html" title="go to the broccoli page"> Broccoli</a>
has large flower heads, usually green in color, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick, edible stalk. The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves.

is a result of careful breeding of cultivated Brassica crops in the northern Mediterranean starting in about the 6th century BC. Since the time of the Roman Empire,
